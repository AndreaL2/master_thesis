## Libraries

The package needed for this analysis is the MADloy one:

```{}
devtools::install_github("isglobal-brge/MADloy_v1")
library(MADloy)
```


## MADloy Analysis

With the path of the Raw_Data folder created before and that contains the .txt files, I can know with individuals present LOY event:

```{}
rawDataPath <- "~/data/PublicData/STUDY/dbGaP/phs000306.v4.p1_GENEVA_Prostate_Cancer/PhenoGenotypeFiles/RootStudyConsentSet_phs000306.GENEVA_MEC_ProstateCancer.v4.p1.c2.GRU-MDS/GenotypeFiles/phg000100.v1.p1.GENEVA_MEC_ProstateCancer_AA.genotype-calls-indfmt.c2.set3/Raw_Data"
rawDataPath

files <- dir(rawDataPath)
length(files)
```


### Filtering females samples

The loss of chromosome Y should be present only in males, that is the reason why I filter my samples and remove the females samples. In some datasets, there are only males, so this step has to be skiped:


```{}
sex <- checkSex(rawDataPath)
sex

pdf("sex.pdf")
plot(sex)
dev.off()
 
sex$par$files[sex$class=="FEMALE"] # Identification of the female samples
files.males <- sex$par$files[sex$class!="FEMALE"] # Removal of the samples
```


Once the data only contains male samples, I can perform the LOY detection:

```{}
ex <- madloy(files.males, mc.cores=1)
ex
```


If I haven't performed the sex filtering, I can analyze the samples directly form the path of the Raw_Data folder:

```{}
ex <- madloy(rawDataPath, mc.cores=20)
ex

pdf("ex.pdf")
plot(ex, print.labels=T, thereshold=-0.3) #LOY event between -0.2 and -0.8 range of Y-axis
dev.off()
```


The last step of the analysis is to ge which individuals have or not LOY:

```{}
LOY <- getLOY(ex)
loy <- LOY$class
```
