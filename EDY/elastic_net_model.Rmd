The objective of the elastic net model created for this package is to predict extreme downregulation of chromosome Y (EDY) from methylation data. 

In order to construct the model, data from The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) was used. 

# Transcriptomic data

# Methylation data

In order to get the methylation data from TCGA, the following packages were used:
```
library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
```

The process was as follows.
